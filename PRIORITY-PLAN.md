## Items That Are DONE ✅

For reference, these are completed and can be ignored:

Wedding Veil, Steamer, Shoes, Sneakers, Earrings & Jewellery, Bridal Party Outfits (Seb, Molly, Hannah), Wedding Dress Alterations, Groom's Suit, Family Grooming, Make Up Artist (booked), Hair Stylist (booked), 2nd Dress, Wedding Rings, Bridal Dressing Robe, Silk Slip/Nighty, Pyjamas for Bridal Party, Guest Book, Couple's Narrative for Celebrant, Confetti (flower petals ordered), Wedding Cars (cancelled — Sonja/Kev + Karen/Mark), Create Website, Photo List, Order of the Day.

---

## Key Risk Areas ⚠️

1. **Feb 25 deadline is only 16 days away** — Guest numbers, dietary info, seating chart, run sheet, and vendor list ALL due to Clare. This is the single most critical milestone.
2. **$19,377 still outstanding with $16,000 in savings** — $3,377 shortfall needs to be saved or trimmed.
3. **59 letters still to send** — With 4 weeks left, consider digital alternatives for speed.
4. **Multiple vendor payments pending** — Florist ($3,400) and Gin Bar ($1,250) are "awaiting confirmation — to be paid." These vendors may not hold bookings indefinitely.
5. **Wedding vows not started** — These take more time than you think. Start this week.
6. **Ceremony plan is TBO** — No processional order, witnesses, or reader confirmed yet.
7. **MCs confirmed (Alcy Meehan & Emma Surkitt)** — They need a detailed run sheet well before the day.
8. **Hens weekend is THIS Friday/Saturday** — Gift boxes, room setup, food, and airport pickup all need to happen in the next 4 days.

*This plan will be updated as tasks are completed. Last updated: 16th February 2026.*

## Design Direction

### Aesthetic
- **Formal & elegant**
- **Modern layout**
- Soft, romantic wildflower/botanical theme

### Colour Palette (from assets)
- Cream / ivory background
- Soft sage green foliage
- Golden yellow accents
- White florals
- Subtle lavender touches

### Assets
Located in `/Image files/`:

| Asset | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `Left Side asset.png` | Left border decoration |
| `right side asset.png` | Right border decoration |
| `both side asset.png` | Bottom decoration (spans both sides) |
| `Wedding venue, purple indicates parking.png` | Venue parking map |
| `Wedding venue, red line indicates princes fwy.png` | Freeway directions |

**Layout concept:** 
```
[Left asset]        CONTENT        [Right asset]
[Both side]         CONTENT        [Both side]
```
Floral assets frame the content vertically on each side – left asset on top-left, right asset on top-right, then "both side" stacked beneath each, creating tall botanical borders.

**No couple photos** – purely botanical and text.

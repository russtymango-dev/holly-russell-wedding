                    <p>You are both <strong>on standby to assist the photography team</strong> during this window. This is not a formal duty but here's how to help:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Familiarise yourself with the <a href="/photo-schedule" class="photo-link">Photo Schedule →</a> before the day so you know who's needed when.</li>
                        <li>When you're not taking your own photos, do your best to gently chase and direct people to the photo area.</li>
                        <li>You won't remember everyone — that's completely fine. Just help where you can.</li>
                        <li>If someone specific can't be found, <strong>Mark Waters (Russell's dad)</strong> will act as runner. He'll come find you if there's an issue locating a particular person.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Alcy</strong> takes the mic first while guests are taking their seats.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cue Jason</strong> (nod/point) to begin playing <em>"Right Here, Right Now"</em> at a lower, ambient volume as a warm-up.</li>
                        <li>Alcy introduces Emma — not just as co-MC, but as the <strong>first member of the bridal party</strong> to be introduced this evening. Make it warm and fun — she's both your partner-in-crime for tonight AND the first of the bridal party walking in.</li>
                        <li>Emma enters and joins Alcy at the front. <strong>Riff off each other for a moment</strong> — get the room engaged and laughing. This is your chance to set the tone for the night. Take your time, enjoy it.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="cue-box">
                        <strong>Suggested framing:</strong> "Before we get started, I need to introduce someone very special — she's one of Holly's dearest friends, she's going to be by my side all night making sure this runs smoothly, and she also happens to be one of the bridesmaids... please welcome Emma Surkitt!" [Emma enters, they greet each other warmly, banter for a moment]
